    About Me

            Computer Science has been something that I have always been interested in. Most of my momâ€™s career has been devoted to working for a software developer, at least for the past twenty-eight years. 
            I can remember sitting on her lap while she would talk to her colleagues about various aspects of her job, such as the best approach for retaining customers, how to provide executives with customer feedback and supporting customers with licensing issues. 
            Thus, I was introduced to computers and software at an early stage in my learning development, which created a good foundation for a career in Computer Science.

            Currently, I am senior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. I grew up in Aurora, Illinois and graduated from West Aurora High School in May 2010. 
            To continue my education, I enrolled at Waubonsee Community College in the Fall of 2010 to pursue my associate degree in Mathematics. I was forced to take a step back from completing my degree to take care of my parents, which allowed me the opportunity to think about the career path I wanted to pursue. 
            During that time, it brought me to the realization that computer programming was my true passion. Beginning in the Fall of 2014, I began my course schedule on a half-time basis at Waubonsee Community College to pursue my degree in Computer Science. In the Fall of 2018, I committed to that dream and enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University.
